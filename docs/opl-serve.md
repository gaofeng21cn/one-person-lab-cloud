# OPL Serve

OPL Serve is the planned OPL Cloud product for publishing a validated OPL Agent
as an externally usable service. It gives Agent builders a stable API and, when
needed, an OPL-hosted user interface without turning the Agent package, sandbox,
or Workspace into a public Web server.

This document defines target positioning and ownership. It is not a delivery,
availability, pricing, security, or production-readiness claim.

## Product Promise

An Agent builder can use OMA or another compatible method to produce an Agent
Package, validate and lock it through OPL Packages, and then publish an exact
revision through OPL Serve.

External consumers can use that service in three ways:

| Mode | Consumer experience | Product boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API | The publisher connects the Agent to an existing App, site, or backend | OPL Serve exposes authenticated invocation and session APIs |
| Embed | The publisher embeds an OPL-provided interaction component | The component uses the same public API and short-lived client credentials |
| Hosted UI | OPL hosts a branded task, report, workflow, or chat surface | The UI is an official API client, not a second execution path |

The publisher may operate several Agent Services. Those services are deployment
resources, not additional OPL Workspaces. The canonical identity remains one
primary OPL Workspace per user account.

## Brand And Product Language

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| OPL Serve | The user-visible Agent publishing and serving product |
| Agent Service | A publisher-owned external service based on an exact Agent Package revision |
| Agent Revision | An immutable package digest, entrypoint, configuration, policy, and provider binding |
| Deployment | The desired serving state and traffic policy for one revision or revision set |
| Invocation | One bounded request to a service |
| Session | A stateful sequence of events against a service revision |
| Hosted UI | An optional OPL-hosted client for the same public service API |

The preferred publisher action is **Publish to OPL Serve**. External consumers
primarily see the publisher's Agent name and brand. A secondary `Hosted on OPL
Cloud` attribution may be shown. Model-provider attribution remains optional and
must follow that provider's branding rules.

`OPL Runtime`, `OPL Deploy`, and `OPL Agents` are not alternative public names:
runtime is an implementation concern, deploy is one lifecycle action, and Agents
would collide with Agent Package and Agent Instance language.

## Publication Flow

```text
Agent design / domain source
-> Agent Package candidate
-> OPL Packages validated manifest + digest + lock
-> Service Entrypoint Contract
-> Agent Service
-> immutable Agent Revision
-> Deployment and traffic policy
-> API / Embed / Hosted UI
-> Invocation or Session
-> Ledger receipt refs
```

OPL Serve does not copy package identity, installed version, digest, dependencies,
or package lifecycle state. It references exact OPL Packages truth and owns only
service publication state.

## Serving Architecture

```text
consumer App / site / Hosted UI
-> OPL Serve Agent Edge
-> service authentication, quota, rate limit and routing
-> OPL Runway invocation or session lifecycle
-> execution provider
-> OPL Fabric resources + OPL Gateway + OPL Connect
-> outputs, events and artifacts
-> OPL Ledger receipt refs
```

The Agent Edge terminates public traffic. A sandbox, container, Workspace URL, or
provider session is never exposed directly as the stable public endpoint.

Short actions may return synchronously within a bounded timeout. Long-running
work returns an `invocation_ref` and continues through event streaming, polling,
or signed Webhooks. Stateful interaction uses an explicit Session rather than
turning every request into an unrelated run.

## Hosted UI Boundary

Initial Hosted UI templates should cover repeatable Agent interaction patterns:

- Task: structured input, background progress, completion, and notification.
- Report: material upload, generated artifacts, review status, and delivery.
- Workflow: multi-stage progress, approval points, outputs, and history.
- Chat: stateful turns, streaming events, file exchange, and interruption.

Templates consume the public Serve API and service entrypoint schemas. They may
project publisher name, logo, theme, domain, authentication mode, inputs,
outputs, events, artifacts, and support links. They do not become a generic site
builder, own service state, or bypass public authentication and quota behavior.

Browser clients use short-lived consumer credentials. A publisher's server-side
service key or provider credential must never be shipped to a browser template
or embed component.

## Ownership

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Agent design, professional behavior, quality and delivery authority | OMA / domain owner / Agent publisher as applicable |
| Package manifest, digest, install, lock, update, rollback and repair | OPL Packages |
| Agent Service, Revision, Deployment, endpoint and traffic state | OPL Serve |
| Account policy, service allowance, budget, quota and billing projection | OPL Console |
| Invocation and Session execution lifecycle | OPL Runway |
| Sandbox, compute, storage, environment, secret injection and network binding | OPL Fabric |
| Model access, provider policy, routing and model usage | OPL Gateway |
| External data and tool access | OPL Connect |
| Invocation, deployment, policy, output and cost receipt refs | OPL Ledger |

Console can request Serve lifecycle actions and project their result, but it does
not become service runtime truth. Fabric can prepare a sandbox or worker, but it
does not own Service or Revision identity. Ledger records refs without becoming
the output, package, service, or professional source of truth.

## Provider Model

OPL Serve is provider-neutral. Runway should expose one execution-provider port
with at least two justified adapters:

- the OPL-native path using Runway orchestration and Fabric-managed execution;
- an external managed-Agent provider when its data, security, lifecycle, and
  commercial constraints are acceptable.

External provider Agent, Environment, Session, or Event identifiers are provider
refs. They cannot replace OPL Service, Revision, Deployment, Invocation, Session,
or Ledger identity. A provider's scheduled deployment object also cannot be
treated as OPL traffic-deployment truth.

## Data And Security Boundary

Each revision declares input/output schemas, permissions, side effects, resource
requirements, data classification, retention, egress, cancellation, and
artifact policies. Serve and Console apply the publisher's account policy before
traffic reaches Runway or Fabric.

Hosted execution does not imply that all data may leave its owner boundary.
Provider eligibility must be selected from the declared data policy. Sensitive
or regulated workloads may require an OPL-native, institution-owned, or otherwise
approved execution path even when another provider offers a managed sandbox.

## Commercial Boundary

The first commercial boundary should bill the publisher account for service,
model, execution, storage, and managed connector usage. Publisher-managed
end-customer charging can remain outside OPL initially.

Marketplace discovery, merchant-of-record payment, tax, refunds, KYC, revenue
sharing, and end-customer subscription management are later product decisions.
They are not required to prove that OPL Serve can publish and operate an Agent
Service.

## Currentness

This target design does not establish a live OPL Serve endpoint. Delivered
capability requires an owning implementation contract, exact package revision,
runtime and security readback, billing evidence, isolation tests, provider soak,
rollback proof, and user-visible invocation receipts.
