# OPL Ledger

Owner: `one-person-lab-cloud`
Purpose: `ledger_target_reference`
State: `active_target_reference`
Machine boundary: Human-readable target evidence reference; runtime and
production evidence come from Ledger source, tests, status, and owner readback.

OPL Ledger is the target evidence-record capability for OPL Cloud work.

It records what happened, which inputs and environments were used, which outputs
were produced, what checks ran, and how the work can be reviewed or continued
later.

Ledger records receipts and provenance while MAS, MAG, RCA, BookForge, OPL App,
and other domain owners retain source truth, quality judgment, and delivery
authority.

## Receipt Shape

Every meaningful App action, Workspace action, Serve deployment or invocation,
or Cloud-managed job should be able to leave a receipt:

```text
plan → approval → command/code → environment → input refs → output refs → reviewer result → owner → continuation ref
```

## What Ledger Owns

- Append-only job and Workspace receipts.
- Reconciliation evidence and idempotency for Ledger writes.
- Receipt retention and privacy lifecycle operations.
- Opaque provenance fields supplied by the calling owner, including artifact,
  review, output, reviewer-check, and continuation refs.

For skill-first flows, Ledger should record which main skill, enhancement pack,
connector, input refs, selected sources, outputs, and continuation entry were
used as opaque provenance. This gives MAS, Workspace, App, and other callers a
shared evidence trail without moving domain truth or continuation authority into
Ledger.

For Serve flows, a receipt should connect exact package digest, service,
revision, deployment, consumer-policy, provider-session, resource, model-usage,
input, output, artifact, review, cost and continuation refs where applicable.
Ledger persists these as caller-owned opaque provenance; provider secrets and
event/session state remain with their owners.

Gateway remains the spendable-balance owner; Control Plane owns account-total
billing and settlement policy, and Console presents it. Ledger records immutable evidence about
money movements and resource charges.

## MVP Boundary

Core Ledger is limited to receipts, reconciliation evidence, idempotency, and
receipt lifecycle operations required by the local Workspace plus Gateway
accounting path. Ledger does not own structured domain Artifact, Review,
ReviewPolicy or Continuation services. Persisted provenance and historical data
custody are documented in [implementation architecture](implementation-architecture.md#persistence);
they do not create a domain API or Workspace authorization. Current capability belongs
to [status](status.md), while any later owner decision belongs only to the
[roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Evidence Record View

Receipts should be useful to people, not only machines. A human-readable record
should answer:

- what was requested;
- who approved it;
- what ran;
- which inputs and environments were used;
- which artifact refs were supplied;
- which review-check refs were supplied;
- what the result was;
- who owns follow-up;
- where the work can continue.

## Retention And Continuation

Ledger keeps enough receipt data to support audit, handoff, and later owner-side
review. Retention policy belongs to the receipt lifecycle owner, while source
data and artifact storage remain with the owning storage or domain system.
`continuationId` and `continuation` are caller-supplied opaque provenance:
Ledger does not generate an identity, resolve a continuation, hide it on reads,
or authorize a Workspace operation.

## Review And Domain Ownership

Each domain owner defines and evaluates its review policies and turns review
outcomes into domain actions. Ledger records only opaque `reviewId`,
`reviewerChecks`, and related refs.

Examples of domain-owned review semantics:

- MAS: citation, statistics, figure-code, and manuscript consistency.
- MAG: funder fit, eligibility, compliance, and budget fields.
- RCA: chart data source, transformation, and narrative consistency.
- BookForge: chapter continuity, citation coverage, style consistency, and
  export readiness.
