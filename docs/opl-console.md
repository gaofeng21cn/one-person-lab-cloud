# OPL Console

Owner: `one-person-lab-cloud`
Purpose: `console_target_reference`
State: `active_target_reference`
Machine boundary: Human-readable target product reference; implementation and
readiness come from Console source, tests, status, and owner readback.

OPL Console is the user and administrator management surface for OPL Cloud. It
manages account onboarding, the account's Workspace collection, plans, balance
and charge projections, quotas, budgets, approvals, and policy for Cloud-hosted
or explicitly managed resources and Agent Services.

The Framework `Console` contribution projects runtime/read-model facts inside
the single Framework Cordis Host and may provide typed client contributions for
an App Shell. OPL Cloud Console presents Cloud accounts, policy, quotas,
Workspace lifecycle, and billing through Control Plane. Control Plane owns the
product APIs and databases; the Cloud repository owns product release. The
`opl-aion-shell` and `opl-studio` projects carry the App GUI.

## MVP Boundary

Core Console is deliberately thin: it exposes the Workspace collection and the
balance and usage facts needed to create and manage one local Docker Workspace
path through Control Plane. Control Plane owns the product DTOs; Sub2API owns
balance and usage, and Ledger supplies receipt projections.

The accepted public-beta target adds zero-balance registration, administrator
top-up and controlled purchase. Customer-operated payment/top-up, broader
managed-resource policy and Serve administration remain deferred. Current capability is owned by [status](status.md); gap and priority
are owned by the [roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Governance Objects

| Object | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Account | Identity, billing, policy, and resource boundary |
| Collaboration policy | Optional sharing of refs, artifacts, and approved resources without sharing Workspace ownership |
| Role | Permission bundle for collaboration, approval, administration, or audit |
| Workspace policy | How each account Workspace is created, accessed, renewed, suspended, deleted, and retained |
| Resource policy | Which compute, storage, connector, and environment refs are permitted |
| Package availability policy | Which exact OPL Package refs may be used by the account Workspace |
| Service policy | Which exact revisions may be published and under which consumer, data, quota, and retention policy |
| Service plan | How managed usage is attributed and billed; not an OPL Package |
| Approval policy | Which actions need approval and who can approve them |
| Audit policy | Which actions require receipts and retention |

## Approval Targets

Console may approve:

- Workspace creation, renewal, recovery, suspension, and deletion;
- connector credentials and explicitly managed access;
- environment, compute, and storage use;
- availability of an exact Package-owner publication ref with fresh carrier
  state;
- Agent Instance creation under account policy;
- creation, deployment, traffic promotion, pause, rollback, custom domain, and
  retention actions for an exact Agent Revision through Serve;
- budget, quota, retention, and reviewer-gate policy.

Package approval is a policy decision only. The Package owner controls identity
and publication bytes; the configured carrier controls install/update/remove
and native readback. Framework only delegates those actions and aggregates
their state.

## Service Plan Model

Billing plans are deliberately not called packages:

| Area | User-facing plan | Metered breakdown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway | AI usage plan | provider, model, tokens, requests |
| Workspace | Workspace service plan | instance, uptime, storage allocation |
| Serve | Agent Service plan | service, revision, deployment, endpoint, invocation/session |
| Compute | Standard or accelerated compute plan | adapter, duration, GPU flag |
| Storage | Workspace or private storage plan | allocation, retention, transfer signal |
| Connectors | Managed connector access | actions and policy events |
| Agents | Agent-run usage | exact package/revision ref, run, resource, and reviewer gate |

The first Serve commercial boundary bills the publisher account. Marketplace,
merchant-of-record, tax, refund, KYC, revenue sharing, and end-customer
subscription behavior are separate later product decisions.

## Metering And Billing Boundary

Console can present Control Plane metering projections for Gateway provider
usage, the managed Workspace plan, Serve endpoint and invocation/session usage,
Cloud-hosted compute and storage, and explicitly managed connector usage.
User-provided local, SSH, or HPC resources can still produce Fabric and Ledger
refs without becoming Cloud-billed by default.

Gateway is the only spendable-balance owner. Control Plane owns the versioned
price catalog, account-total billing projection and settlement policy, and
orchestrates one Workspace monthly debit against that Gateway balance. Console
presents Control Plane DTOs. Fabric returns resource and provider facts, while
Ledger records append-only charge, refund, resource, and reconciliation
receipts.

An exact package or revision ref attached to usage is attribution metadata.
Package owners, carriers, Serve, and domain owners supply the descriptor,
installed state, service state, and readiness facts that Console presents.

## Product Boundary

Ordinary users ultimately use Console for account onboarding, balance and usage, Workspace
creation and lifecycle, and support; they perform professional work in App or
Workspace. Administrators use Console to decide who may use or publish which
managed capability and under what budget or policy.
Serve performs Agent Service lifecycle actions, Runway owns Invocation/Session
execution, Fabric executes approved resource bindings, the configured carrier
performs Package mutations through Framework delegation, and Ledger records
refs. Domain owners retain professional quality and delivery authority.
