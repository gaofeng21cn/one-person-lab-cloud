# OPL Connect

Owner: `one-person-lab-cloud`
Purpose: `connect_target_reference`
State: `active_target_reference`
Machine boundary: Human-readable target connector definition. It does not prove
provider access, adapter availability, package health, source truth, domain
readiness, or production readiness.

OPL Connect is the target connector capability inside OPL Fabric. It defines a
stable access boundary for App, Workspace, and approved domain agents to use
external data sources, literature providers, databases, tool APIs, and
institutional systems. Serve invocations may use the same target capability
through Runway and Fabric when an exact revision and consumer data policy permit
it.

## Connector Responsibility

Connect owns:

- connector request/result envelopes;
- credential and data-egress boundaries;
- provider-specific access behavior;
- normalized source refs;
- errors, retries, cache metadata and rate limits;
- provider execution receipts.

Connect does not own:

- OPL Package discovery, install, update, rollback, repair or lock;
- domain retrieval strategy, inclusion judgment or evidence synthesis;
- source truth, professional quality verdict or delivery authority;
- account/service approval, quota or billing policy.

## Standard Call Shape

```text
App / Workspace / domain Agent
-> capability request
-> OPL Connect provider adapter
-> normalized source refs + provider receipt
-> domain workflow
-> optional Ledger receipt refs
```

Console may approve account-managed credentials, providers, service egress and
quotas.
Ledger may retain connector and source refs. Neither changes connector or
domain truth.

## Package Boundary

A connector adapter can be carried by an OPL Package. OPL Packages validates
and installs that package, owns its digest and lock, and performs updates or
repair. Connect only loads or invokes the already resolved adapter ref. Fabric
binds the adapter and its credentials/resources to a run.

This separation prevents connector catalogs and package registries from
becoming two competing descriptions of the same installed bytes.

## Domain Adapter Boundary

Generic shared providers belong in OPL Connect when their access semantics are
stable across domains. A domain-specific provider path remains with its domain
adapter when normalization, evidence semantics or quality decisions are
domain-owned.

For example, medical PubMed access and medical normalization currently belong
to the MAS adapter. Cloud docs may describe a future shared connector pattern,
but must not expose a compatibility command or readiness claim that does not
exist in fresh Framework and MAS readback.

## Governance And Evidence

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Connector access, refs, credentials, provider errors/retries/rate limits | OPL Connect |
| Adapter package manifest, install, lock, update and repair | OPL Packages |
| Account/service availability, credential approval, quota and audit policy | OPL Console |
| Resource and environment binding | OPL Fabric |
| Retrieval strategy, evidence use, writing and review | Domain Agent |
| Receipt/provenance refs and continuation entry | OPL Ledger |

Connector availability, package health, policy approval and domain readiness
are separate states and must remain separately readable.
