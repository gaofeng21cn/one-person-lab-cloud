# OPL Cloud Durable Invariants

This document contains only facts that must survive implementation changes.
Exact routes, DTO fields, stage names, retry counts, schemas, compatibility
decoders, and workflow steps belong to source, focused contracts, tests, or
current implementation documentation.

## Authority

- Control Plane owns customer sessions, account policy, Workspace business
  operations, settlement coordination, and customer-facing DTOs.
- Fabric owns provider-neutral compute, storage, attachment, Secret binding,
  Runtime facts, provider operations, and provider-authoritative readback.
- Ledger owns append-only receipts, evidence, retention, reconciliation, and
  caller-supplied opaque provenance.
- Sub2API owns customer identity credentials, API Keys, Usage, and the spendable
  wallet balance.
- An instance repository owns its domains, provider profile, production
  environment, Secrets, deployment, rollback, acceptance, and receipts.
- Each authoritative fact has one writer. Other modules consume it through a
  typed public contract or an owner readback.

## Physical Ownership

- Control Plane, Fabric, and Ledger remain separate processes, Go modules, and
  PostgreSQL schema owners.
- Cross-service integration uses typed HTTP APIs. A service reads and writes
  only its own tables.
- Console calls Control Plane product APIs. Provider, wallet, and Ledger access
  stays behind the owning server boundary.
- Shared infrastructure remains policy-free and serves at least two current
  owners.

## Identity And Secrets

- Customer access is authorized from the current session, Account, User, and
  downstream identity mapping. Operator visibility does not grant customer
  ownership.
- Protected reads and mutations require an unambiguous owner match from the
  authoritative source.
- Passwords, raw Keys, tokens, provider credentials, approval payloads, and raw
  downstream responses stay out of URLs, logs, audit payloads, Ledger, browser
  storage, and non-secret artifacts.
- Secret reveal is an explicit owner-authorized, private, no-store interaction.
  Ordinary status projections remain redacted.
- A Workspace Gateway Key is persisted only by the selected Fabric secret
  owner. Control Plane and Ledger retain references, not the raw Key.

## Money

- Customer prices and wallet mutations use integer USD micros. Provider costs
  are reconciliation evidence, not a customer pricing formula.
- A Workspace purchase or renewal confirms at most one customer debit for the
  accepted period price. Compute and storage are fulfillment of that purchase.
- Operations that can change money use stable idempotency identities and retain
  enough evidence to distinguish confirmed, absent, and unknown outcomes.
- A confirmed absence of all billable fulfillment after a debit may authorize
  one idempotent refund. Partial, conflicting, or unknown evidence requires
  review before another monetary mutation.
- Receipt failure retries the receipt only; it does not repeat an already
  confirmed debit, refund, provider operation, activation, or renewal.

## Workspace Lifecycle

- Launch, renewal, Key rotation, Runtime repair, and deletion are durable
  Control Plane operations over one Workspace identity.
- Recovery continues the original operation and original resource identities.
  It cannot create a second purchase or silently replace an already confirmed
  resource.
- An authorized image revision for an existing unready Runtime preserves the
  Launch, Runtime operation, service identity, stage request hash, idempotency
  key, and all non-Runtime resources; only owner-authoritative READY readback
  may advance the original Launch.
- Before an external write, the owning operation persists its identity and
  idempotency binding. An uncertain result converges through owner-authoritative
  readback before another write is considered.
- Workspace deletion removes owned Runtime, Secret, attachment, storage,
  compute, and Key state through their respective owners before removing the
  Workspace projection. Delete is independent from refund and performs no
  automatic wallet mutation.
- Operations that can mutate the same Workspace-owned resource serialize on the
  owning durable state.
- Historical rows needed for current reads or migration validation remain
  readable until their real consumers and data obligations are retired.

## Provider Resources

- Provider selection and concrete resource policy come from the active instance
  profile. Provider-specific behavior stays inside the Fabric adapter.
- Customer and verification compute/storage procurement uses the approved
  prepaid monthly policy. Capacity and price checks are read-only.
- Provider mutations bind the authorized caller, exact target, operation,
  allowed action, request integrity, and expiry.
- Provider absence, ownership, and completion come from the provider authority.
  Ambiguous or conflicting facts require review before another mutation.
- Instance-designated system resources remain outside customer allocation and
  cleanup.

## Console

- Console presents current owner-backed account, wallet, Workspace, Usage,
  receipt, and failure facts.
- Independent sources load independently. A failed source does not erase valid
  facts from another source.
- `empty` represents a successful authoritative read with no rows;
  `unavailable` represents a failed authoritative read and carries no invented
  zero value.
- Sensitive values are masked by default and revealed only through the owning
  command.
- Accessibility and clear responsive interaction are product requirements;
  visual details remain implementation choices.

## Release And Production

- Cloud publishes portable product artifacts. The instance owner deploys and
  qualifies an immutable Cloud candidate in its own protected environment.
- Publication and deployment bind exact source commits, image digests, caller
  authority, and owner readback. A build or test result proves only its own
  layer.
- Production credentials are available only inside the smallest authorized
  publish or instance-mutation boundary.
- Local development does not connect directly to production-private services.
- Ordinary verification is read-only with respect to customer billing and
  provider resources. Real mutations require separate explicit authorization.

## Evidence Levels

- `code-complete` means the exact source revision passed its required local
  source, build, persistence, and integration gates with no required skips.
- `pilot-ready` additionally requires approved real Gateway, Runtime, provider,
  billing, and browser evidence for that revision.
- `production-proven` additionally requires the same immutable revision to be
  deployed and read back by the production owner.
- Evidence is reported at the layer actually observed; lower-layer evidence
  does not imply a higher layer.
