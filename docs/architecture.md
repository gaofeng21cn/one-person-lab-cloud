# OPL Cloud Architecture

Owner: `one-person-lab-cloud`
Purpose: `architecture_boundary`
State: `active_target_reference`
Machine boundary: Canonical human-readable target architecture; implementation
and readiness come from lower-layer owners and readback.

OPL Cloud is the target product architecture and implementation-family
navigation surface for extending OPL work from a local App into online
workspaces, account-managed resources and remote execution. This document
defines responsibility boundaries; it does not claim that every service is
currently deployed.

## OPL Family Position

The stable external product model is `OPL Base + OPL App + OPL Packages + OPL
Cloud`. OPL Cloud is the online product layer under active implementation;
individual Cloud capabilities are adopted according to the user's work. Internally these are separate
authorities:

```text
OPL Base           Framework runtime product; implemented by the single Cordis Host
OPL Packages       independently published installable capabilities and owner revisions
OPL Framework      Host-side discovery/projection and runtime/state/action producer
one-person-lab-app App product, Client profile, GUI ABI and release authority
opl-aion-shell     current Stable AionUI Shell carrier
opl-studio         DSH-derived candidate Shell carrier
OPL Cloud          Console, Control Plane, Fabric, Ledger and Workspace product
```

Cloud is not a second Framework Host and does not own the desktop App or either
Shell. A desktop or browser Shell may render Cloud projections through the same
App-owned contribution and state/action ABI, while Cloud services retain their
process, database, API, release and provider authorities. Changing the selected
App Shell therefore does not migrate Cloud authority or make Cloud a GUI plugin.

The name `Console` appears in two layers but does not identify one authority:
the Framework Console contribution is an in-process read-model/inspection
projection; OPL Console in this repository is the account and administrator
product for policy, quota, approval, Workspace and billing views.

## Family Capability Domains And Cloud Surfaces

Names such as Console, Workspace, Fabric, Ledger, Connect, Runway, and Packages
are OPL family capability domains: stable product and responsibility language
that may span Framework, App, Cloud, and domain products. They are not a fixed
count of Framework source modules, repositories, published packages, or Cordis
plugins. A domain keeps one conceptual name while each repository owns only its
explicit authority surface.

The composition model is:

```text
OPL family capability domain
  -> repository/product-specific authority surface
       -> versioned Package, service image, contract, or other artifact
            -> host-specific contribution where a host exists
                 -> curated product/profile composition
```

These boundaries are intentionally independent. A capability domain may have no
resident plugin, one artifact may contribute multiple plugins, and a Cloud
service may expose a typed API without becoming a Package or Cordis plugin.
Versioning and replacement follow the artifact with a real release cadence, not
the family domain name or a mechanically preserved module count.

For Cloud, the authority surfaces are concrete products and services:

| Family capability domain | Cloud authority surface | Boundary outside Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Console | Cloud Console and Control Plane own the account/control-plane product, Workspace policy, approval, quota and billing projection | Framework may expose operator/readiness/action projections; App owns local product interaction, neither owns Cloud policy or service state |
| Workspace | Control Plane owns Cloud Workspace entitlement and Launch coordination; Fabric owns runtime/resource binding and readback | App/Workspace runtime owns project and workbench behavior; Framework owns only shared runtime composition |
| Fabric | Fabric owns provider-neutral remote resource facts, mutation ports and provider adapters | Framework and App consume typed adapters and cannot acquire provider or deployment authority |
| Ledger | Cloud Ledger owns Cloud receipts, reconciliation, idempotency, and caller-owned opaque provenance refs | Framework observers and product projections do not become the persistent Cloud Ledger or a review/continuation authority |
| Remote Companion / OPL Link | `opl-link/service` owns broker, pairing, capacity and provider transport authority | OPL Cloud only hosts Workspace/WebUI delivery and does not own a remote-companion route, provider, persistence or contract |
| Gateway / Wallet | Control Plane projects Gateway account data and coordinates settlement | Sub2API remains the external identity, spendable-wallet, Key, routing and usage authority |
| Packages / Connect / Runway | Cloud consumes exact owner refs, connector capabilities and execution results where required | Package owners, native carriers and Framework retain discovery, carrier currentness, connector access and invocation lifecycle |

This rebaseline keeps the family vocabulary useful without making a Cloud
directory, service, API, package, or plugin the owner of the whole brand.

## Repository And Instance Topology

```text
one-person-lab-cloud
  product architecture, whitepaper, roadmap
  Console + Control Plane + Fabric + Ledger implementation
  reusable contracts, portable images and GitHub Releases
        | immutable product SHA + image digest
        v
opl-instance-medopl
  medopl customization, production environment, deployment, rollback and evidence
```

`one-person-lab-cloud` is the single product and implementation repository.
Console, Control Plane, Fabric, and Ledger remain logical service owners inside
it; similarly named prototype repositories are historical inputs, not parallel
current writers. The short identifier `opl-cloud` remains valid for packages,
images, binaries, services, namespaces, environment variables and runner
labels, but it is not a repository boundary.

An instance repository materializes one installation without copying product or
runtime code. It owns non-secret domains, provider selection, region and
resource profile, the enabled subset of Cloud-defined plans, image pins, secret
references, and deployment receipts. Cloud Control Plane owns the versioned
customer price catalog; an Instance cannot override it. An instance may run on
a hosted cloud or a supported Linux Docker host. macOS may run the
control-services profile, but Docker Desktop is not a supported Local-Docker
Workspace host under the current project-quota contract. Secrets remain in the
selected secret owner, never in the instance repository.

## Development And Supply-Chain Authority

GitHub Actions, dependency scanners, code scanners, and cloud coding agents are
development and evidence surfaces. They do not own OPL Cloud product intent,
module policy, runtime state, release identity, or instance production
authorization. Their output enters the repository through the same protected
branch, review-conversation, focused-test, and canonical-readback boundaries as
human-authored work.

The release trust boundary separates untrusted source, dependency, and image
build activity from the credentials that publish GHCR images and GitHub
Releases. Cloud owns the portable release and its verifiable identity. An
Instance consumes an exact Cloud release and independently owns deployment
approval and production readback. A content digest establishes immutability; an
approved repository or release manifest establishes source trust.

## Current Public Beta Cut

The reusable Cloud Core remains deliberately narrow: a thin Console, one
`local-docker` OPL Workspace path, and OPL Gateway accounting projected without
creating a second wallet. The current delivery target adds public account
registration with zero initial balance, administrator-operated wallet top-up,
and controlled Workspace purchase. Registration never purchases resources by
itself; the authoritative quote and Sub2API balance gate every purchase.

Customer-operated payment/top-up, shared multi-user Workspaces, HA, GPU, public
Agent Service publication, and broader managed-resource orchestration remain
later product layers rather than public-beta prerequisites.

Tencent/TKE is a medopl instance provider choice and migration surface. Existing
Tencent/TKE source and workflow evidence may remain current implementation
facts until the instance cutover is complete, but they do not define generic
Cloud identity, MVP acceptance, or the portable provider contract.

The portable product Release nevertheless contains and contract-tests both the
Local-Docker and Tencent/TKE adapters. They consume the same Cloud image and
provider-neutral contracts while receiving separate installation-owned
Workspace images, Provider Profiles, domains, and qualification receipts.

## Surface Roles

| Surface | Owner responsibility | Explicit non-owner boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OPL Gateway | AI access, routing, provider policy and usage signals | Package state and domain quality |

| OPL Runway | Invocation/session lifecycle and execution-provider routing | Service identity, package lifecycle and domain verdicts |
| Domain agent | Domain strategy, evidence judgment, quality verdict and delivery authority | Cloud infrastructure truth |

## Host, Client, And Cloud Authority Boundary

OPL Framework is the Host composition authority. Its Host Cordis context selects
a curated product profile, mounts Framework-side contributions, and projects an
allowlisted client graph. An OPL App renderer may create a Host-derived Client
Cordis context from that projection and compose typed views, slots, actions,
RPCs, and events. The Client context is not a second Host: it cannot discover or
install plugins independently, own Package currentness, redefine the App product
profile, or acquire Cloud service authority.

```text
OPL App product profile
  -> Framework Host Cordis composition
       |-- Framework-owned Cloud client/adapter contribution
       |      -> typed public HTTP and capability contracts
       |           -> OPL Cloud Control Plane / Fabric / Ledger authorities
       |
       +-- projected allowlisted client graph
              -> Host-derived App Client Cordis composition
                   -> typed slots, views and actions
                        -> AionUI mainline renderer
                        -> DSH-GUI-derived candidate renderer
```

AionUI and the DSH-GUI-derived candidate are alternative renderer/package
carriers for one App product contract. They consume the same Host projection,
client contribution descriptors, slot/action ABI, and product profile; renderer
selection cannot create separate Cloud APIs, Package registries, currentness,
action truth, or product policy.

Cloud integration uses typed public APIs with explicit capability, identity,
idempotency, and owner-authoritative readback. Fabric owns provider selection and
mutation behind its provider port; the owning Instance supplies the profile.

## Core And Extension Boundary

The MVP Core is one installable vertical product path:

```text
thin Console
-> Control Plane
-> Workspace launcher/provider
-> local Docker OPL App/WebUI Workspace
-> Gateway balance, usage, and debit authority in Sub2API
-> minimal Ledger receipts and reconciliation evidence
```

Core completion requires a real Workspace create, readback, access, and delete
path on a supported Linux Docker host. Starting the Cloud control services with
Compose is distribution plumbing and cannot satisfy this boundary. Console
remains limited to the Workspace, balance, and usage controls needed by that
path. Delete performs no wallet mutation; Sub2API remains the only spendable
wallet, and Ledger does not become a second wallet or accounting engine.

Extensions include Tencent/TKE and generic Kubernetes provider adapters,
managed or institution-owned resources, OPL Serve, customer-operated payment,
detailed Console refinement, and Ledger evidence verticals not required by the
Core path. The current public-beta cut selects self-service signup and
administrator top-up while retaining Sub2API as the single wallet authority.
An instance selects deployment extensions without redefining the Core product.
`opl-instance-medopl` selects the Tencent/TKE extension for the medopl instance;
Tencent/TKE is not a prerequisite for the local Core journey, but it is a
supported adapter of the portable Release.

This section owns the stable Core/Extension technical boundary. Current
capability belongs to [status](status.md), while gaps and priority belong only
to the [roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Launch Authority And Physical Ownership

One Workspace Launch has one durable Control Plane operation and state machine.
Create and Resume enter the same Reconciler, but the Reconciler coordinates
separate physical owners rather than implementing their work:

```text
services/control-plane
  business stage cursor + attempt/lease/CAS + settlement coordination
        |-- typed public Fabric HTTP contract --> services/fabric
        |                                        immutable launch/stage binding
        |                                        operation store + resource stages
        |                                        provider adapter mutation/readback
        |                                              |
        |                                              +-> local-docker, Tencent/TKE, or another adapter
        |-- typed public Ledger HTTP contract --> services/ledger
        |                                        append-only receipt/evidence/refs
        +-- typed external client -------------> Sub2API
                                                 identity/wallet/Key/Usage
```

The durable business chain is `preflight -> key -> debit -> ensure compute
allocation -> storage -> attachment -> secret -> runtime -> activation ->
receipt -> succeeded`. Preflight is the read-only admission gate before the
first external write. Runtime supplies the authoritative Workspace URL as
readback/projection; URL is not a separate mutation stage.

For Tencent prepaid resources, preflight must prove both the live deployment
identity and its payment authority before Debit. The Candidate-bound deployment
attestation includes the exact required Tag actions and Tencent system policy
`QcloudCVMFinanceAccess`. Compute and storage preflight both re-read the live
STS identity and current CAM attachment and reject a missing, inactive, or
mismatched policy. Price inquiry alone is not payment proof and cannot admit a
customer charge.

Workspace deletion is another durable Control Plane operation, not an
acceptance-runner cleanup. `workspace.delete.v2` first matches the immutable
succeeded Launch and its exact Launch Receipt. Runtime, compute, storage, and
attachment identity remain bound to that Launch; the current Workspace Key and
Gateway Secret identity come from the current Workspace projection and a strict
completed Rotation lineage back to the Launch Key. Delete then coordinates
`runtime + Secret absence -> attachment absence -> storage absence -> compute
absence -> Sub2API Key absence -> Workspace absence -> workspace.deleted.v1
Receipt -> complete`. Workspace absence atomically removes its exact Control
Plane compute, storage, and attachment projections. Every stage preserves the
same account, operation, Workspace, Launch Receipt, Runtime, current Key, and
provider-neutral resource identities. Fabric owns resource/Secret observations,
mutation, and authoritative absence; Sub2API owns only the exact Key deletion
in this operation and performs no wallet mutation; Ledger records the
non-financial deletion Receipt. Delete and Key Rotation are durably mutually
exclusive before either claim can cross an external mutation boundary. Delete,
Cancel Renewal, and Refund are independent operations. Any typed pending,
conflict, or error that cannot authoritatively converge fails closed.

Control Plane owns only the Launch cursor, attempt and lease state, CAS,
account/settlement coordination, and customer projection. Fabric owns compute,
storage, attachment, Secret binding, Runtime, its operation store, provider and
Kubernetes mutation, and authoritative resource readback. Ledger retains
append-only receipts, reconciliation, idempotency, and caller-owned opaque
provenance refs; those refs cannot authorize or advance Launch. Control Plane's
typed continuation authorization remains a separate owner-owned path. Sub2API
remains the external identity, wallet, Key, and Usage authority.

Each Control Plane-to-Fabric stage call uses an explicit, immutable,
provider-neutral binding for the Launch operation, account and Workspace,
stage/action, stable stage operation/idempotency identity, request hash, and
expected resource binding. Fabric persists it before a provider write, returns
it with readback, and lets the selected adapter map it to provider identities.
Control Plane cannot infer resource ownership from idempotency suffixes,
unscoped operation listings, provider tags, or Machine/CVM/Node/CBS fields.

Recovery only persists and consumes an immutable authorization for the original
Launch version and stage. Mutation, exact-idempotency replay, and typed
continuation-read budgets are independent: replay never increments the stage's
`Attempted` or `Max=1`, and read-budget exhaustion becomes
`unknown/manual_review` without proving owner absence. Fabric adapters opt in
only after exact owner readback and a durable same-operation child CAS claim,
then repeat the owner read immediately before reusing the original key. Recovery
cannot own a business stage, rewrite a resource identity, create a successor
Launch, or call a provider directly. The exact public binding shape is admitted
only with a real caller, source implementation in both owners, and focused
tests; this architecture does not freeze a speculative universal JSON contract.
For a resource-billed Launch whose original Storage attempt is already
`unknown/manual_review`, an operator may authorize recovery of that exact
stage through the same Reconciler. Fabric first reads the immutable original
binding: `ready` confirms the attempt without mutation, `pending` remains
read-only, and only authoritative `absent` may reuse the original idempotency
key once. Unknown, conflict, read failure, identity drift, or another unproven
result leaves the same Launch fail-closed without creating another volume.
If that exact replay was dispatched and ended with a terminal failed claim, a
new zero-mutation authorization may classify the same Fabric binding again.
Exact `ready` confirms the original attempt without mutation. Authoritative
`absent` may replace only that exact failed claim and replay the original
idempotency key once; `pending`, `unknown`, read failure, conflict, or identity
drift leaves the operation byte-for-byte unchanged. This remains the same
Launch and Fabric operation and cannot create a second purchase or volume key.
The durable authorization history rejects every later replay authorization,
including when this final replay ends without a conclusive readback.
For a resource-billed Launch whose Runtime attempt is already
`unknown/manual_review`, an operator may authorize recovery of the exact
original Fabric binding through the same Reconciler. A zero-mutation,
zero-replay authorization advances only after authoritative `ready` readback.
When the original apply failed before any Runtime resource existed, a separate
zero-mutation, one-replay authorization advances only after authoritative
`absent` readback, then reuses the original Runtime idempotency key once.
`pending`, `unknown`, read failure, identity drift, or any ineligible attempt
leaves the operation unchanged in `manual_review`.

For Tencent/TKE, an identity-exact original Runtime that exists but is blocked
only by its immutable old Workspace image continues through that same Resume
route and Reconciler. The administrator supplies the replacement digest, while
Control Plane binds it to the current deployed Workspace image, exact Launch
version, authenticated reviewer, original Runtime operation, and original
stage idempotency key. The original admitted image and stage request hash do
not change. Fabric admits only old-image-only drift, durably claims one image
revision replay on the existing Tencent Runtime child operation, and requires
the same authorization proof on every read and apply. READY advances the
original Launch to Activation and its single Receipt. Any unrelated identity,
image, proof, or provider drift remains fail-closed without another apply.

Local-Docker Fulfillment Repair is a separate operator mutation command under the same
Workspace Launch owner; it does not widen Recovery. It applies only after a
resource-billed Launch has confirmed its Key, Debit, Compute, Storage,
Attachment, and Secret, consumed its single Runtime attempt as unknown, and has
not attempted Activation or Receipt. Control Plane supplies only a new immutable
image digest and persists the repair authorization on the original Launch,
including the authenticated operator identity and server authorization time.
Fabric proves the original Runtime operation and retained resource bindings,
then an explicitly opted-in provider adapter may replace only the Runtime while
preserving the Runtime ID/service identity and the existing Secret, Compute,
Storage, and Attachment. READY readback returns the original Launch to
Activation and its single Purchase Receipt; exact replay cannot create another
Key, Debit, provider resource set, Secret, Runtime replacement, or Receipt.

Fresh mutation continuation is a separate Control Plane system authorization,
never an operator Resume authorization. It exists only when the mandatory first
post-mutation owner read returns exact typed `pending`, and the same operation
CAS binds account, Launch, Workspace, stage, original idempotency key, attempt,
and operation version. Each read claim is persisted before its GET; concurrent
CAS losers perform no GET, and a crashed claim consumes its ordinal
permanently. Non-compute stages retain zero replay budget and only two
additional owner reads after the mandatory read.

Compute allocation has a provider-latency-specific ten-minute deadline and at
most sixty additional worker read claims after the mandatory read.
`pending/provider_provisioning` remains read-only. Once exact Fabric/provider
readback changes to `pending/ownership_pending`, that compute authorization may
claim one exact-idempotency continuation of the same Fabric stage. Fabric must
discover the already-created Machine before claiming its ownership, so this
continuation cannot issue a second NodePool scale. `ready` advances the same
Launch; unknown, conflict, error, or exact budget/deadline exhaustion enters
`unknown/manual_review` without another unproven external mutation.

An administrator may resume only the historical compute operation already
parked by the former untyped provider-pending result. The existing Resume route
first performs authoritative readback and admits only
`provider_provisioning` or `ownership_pending`; it then restores the original
attempt to the bounded compute continuation above. `ready`, `absent`,
`unknown`, read failure, or identity conflict leaves the operation unchanged.
If that compatibility replay itself ended `failed` before a corrected owner
classifier could prove the existing Machine, one new explicit administrator
authorization may replace that terminal claim exactly once after the same
authoritative admission. The prior authorization remains in the operation
history; the stage, attempt, Fabric operation, resource binding, and idempotency
key cannot change, and a second replacement is refused.
This does not authorize a general unknown recovery path, a successor Launch, a
new stage attempt, another debit, or direct Receipt creation. Legacy schema-v3
rows without explicit authorization and claim fields have zero system
continuation budget.

## Modularity And Simplification Boundary

Each implementation module is paid for by a current product responsibility,
real caller, public contract, persisted-state obligation, or independently
deployable owner boundary. Repository co-location does not permit cross-service
imports or shared domain state, while a future possibility does not by itself
justify a route, schema, store, worker, facade, workflow, or compatibility layer.
Code without one of those payers is implementation evidence only, not target
architecture, and enters the roadmap as a keep, shrink, or delete candidate.

Modules stay cohesive around their owned capability and communicate through
typed product or service contracts. Internal file splits may reduce change
collisions, but must not create cross-module packages, mirror another owner's
truth, or duplicate launch/recovery, wallet, provider, or receipt authority.
One durable Reconciler never justifies moving Fabric resource reducers,
operation derivation, mutations, or provider facts into Control Plane.
Once real callers move to a successor, the old route, DTO, facade, schema, and
test path retire as one bounded change rather than a permanent fallback.

Physical deployment isolation, product feature development, and internal
cohesion are independent lanes. They may proceed concurrently and converge at a
shared contract, canonical integration, or exact deployment qualification. An
unfinished isolation or refactor lane is not a global development prerequisite.
Current priorities and admission decisions belong only to
[the roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Workspace Identity Boundary

Each user account may own zero or more independent OPL Workspaces. Every
Workspace has its own stable identity, URL, runtime, storage, provider binding,
billing period, credentials, lifecycle, and receipts. OPL Cloud sets no fixed
product-level count limit; balance, provider capacity, quota, and account
policy still govern each creation. Projects, tasks, files, artifacts, and
continuation entries remain inside their selected Workspace and do not become
Workspace identity.

The OPL App active shell provides the browser carrier. The complete identity
decision is recorded in
[Workspace Identity And External SaaS Boundary](workspace-identity-and-external-saas-boundary.md).

Agent Services do not change this identity. Workspaces and Services can both be
zero-to-many per account, but Services remain deployment resources for external
consumers rather than workbench instances.

## Service Publication Boundary

OPL Serve publishes an exact package revision through a dedicated Agent Edge:

```text
Agent Package exact digest
-> Service Entrypoint Contract
-> Agent Service
-> immutable Agent Revision
-> Deployment and traffic policy
-> API / Embed / Hosted UI
-> Invocation or Session
```

The Agent Edge owns public authentication, request validation, rate limits,
quota, routing, event streaming and signed Webhooks. Public traffic does not
terminate at a Workspace, sandbox, container or external provider session.

Runway owns the OPL Invocation and Session lifecycle and routes each exact
revision to an approved execution-provider adapter. The OPL-native Runway/Fabric
path and any external managed-Agent runtime remain adapters; their identifiers
are refs, not OPL Service or Deployment truth.

Hosted UI and Embed clients consume the same Serve API. They may project an
Agent's schemas, events, artifacts and publisher branding, but cannot bypass
Serve authentication, policy, quota or receipts.

## Execution Boundary

OPL App and OPL Workspace use the same resource execution pattern:

```text
plan -> approve -> execute -> monitor -> collect -> receipt
```

Console applies account or explicit shared policy when a workspace, connector
or resource is Cloud-hosted or managed. Fabric performs the approved resource
binding and execution. User-provided local, SSH or HPC resources can use the
same pattern without becoming Console-billed resources by default.

Fabric exposes a provider-neutral capability interface. Core requires a real
`local-docker` profile; an instance may additionally select an extension such
as `tencent-tke` or generic `kubernetes`. Provider identifiers, diagnostics, retries, and recovery
mutations stay inside the adapter. Control Plane persists the selected provider
profile ref per Workspace and uses one Launch business state machine; Fabric
persists each stage-operation binding and provider-resource mapping. Neither
generic product identity nor Control Plane contains Tencent resource names.

## Balance And Billing Boundary

Gateway is the only spendable account-balance owner. Cloud Control Plane owns
the versioned customer price catalog, quotes, account-total billing projection,
and settlement policy, and initiates one monthly settlement per Workspace and
billing period. Console only presents Control Plane DTOs. Fabric reports
resource/provider facts and owns no wallet, balance, or customer price. Ledger
records append-only charge, refund, resource, and reconciliation receipts
without becoming a second balance store or pricing engine.

## Package Lifecycle Boundary

There is no Cloud-owned Agent Registry. Package identity, capabilities,
entrypoints and exact publication revisions come from the Package owner.
Physical install/update/remove and installed/callable state come from fresh
readback of the configured native carrier. Framework `opl packages` discovers
descriptors, delegates carrier actions and aggregates those owner/carrier
projections; it is not a second resolver, lock or currentness authority.

Legacy Framework lock, payload, lifecycle-receipt or rollback projections may
remain during migration. Cloud target contracts must not make them a new
consumer or use them as ordinary Package identity, dependency or readiness
gates.

Cloud surfaces consume those refs without redefining them:

- Console projects whether account policy permits a package ref and which
  quotas or managed resources may use it.
- Fabric reads package requirements and binds compute, storage, environments
  and connectors for a run.
- App and Workspace display owner identity plus fresh carrier state and actions
  aggregated by Framework.
- Ledger may record exact publication, carrier-action and carrier-readback refs
  for later review.

None of these projections can install, update, remove, repair or create a
second package or carrier truth. Mutations route to the configured carrier.

## Connector And Domain Boundary

OPL Connect owns stable connector access, normalized source refs, credential
boundaries, errors, retries and rate limits. Domain-specific adapters and
domain agents own retrieval strategy, evidence selection, synthesis and quality
judgment. Ledger records refs only.

The current OPL connector surface and any domain-specific adapter must be read
from fresh Framework/domain contracts and runtime readback. A target connector
described in Cloud docs is not a readiness claim.

## Data Boundary

Cloud stores refs, metadata, lineage, receipts, usage and policy records.
Sensitive source data remains in user workspaces, institutional storage or
private buckets by default. A Cloud receipt points back to the owning source; it
does not become a second source of truth.

External service traffic adds a consumer identity, data classification,
retention, deletion and egress boundary. Serve and Console must resolve those
policies before Runway selects a provider or Fabric binds resources.

## Currentness Boundary

This repository explains the target product split. Service availability comes
from the corresponding implementation repo, API contract, runtime health and
owner receipt. Package currentness comes from the owning publication surface and
fresh native-carrier readback, exposed through Framework aggregation where
available.

## Account Admission And Workspace Purchase

Sub2API remains the Gateway identity and spendable-wallet authority. Control
Plane owns the Cloud Account and the separate `workspacePurchaseEnabled` fact;
the existence of a remote identity, a local Account, or an existing Workspace
does not grant new-purchase permission. Operator provisioning explicitly selects
`full_cloud_customer` or `gateway_only`, and grant/revoke actions are audited.
The launch route reads this Control Plane fact before any billing or Fabric
mutation. Revocation affects only future purchases. Historical account migration
and removal of the Instance per-account pilot allowlist are separate,
product-approved compatibility work; a fresh deployment does not use that
per-account environment variable for launch admission.
Contract presence, documentation, a successful build or an empty queue does not
prove Cloud, package, domain or production readiness.
