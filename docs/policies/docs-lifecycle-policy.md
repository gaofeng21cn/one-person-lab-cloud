# Documentation Lifecycle Policy

This repository applies the OPL Doc method through the hierarchy in
`docs/README.md`. The policy governs semantic ownership; it does not prescribe
one file layout for every topic.

## One Topic, One Current Owner

Classify each changed section as `current_truth`, `active_gap`,
`support_detail`, `history_or_provenance`, or `stale_or_conflicting`.

- Keep one current owner for each semantic topic.
- Reduce other active documents to a pointer plus unique support detail.
- Put all open work in `docs/roadmap.md`; put current evidence in
  `docs/status.md`.
- Move dated plans, design freezes, screenshots, execution logs, raw
  verification output and completed ledgers to `docs/history/**` or rely on Git
  history when no non-resurrection record is needed.
- Delete stale or conflicting text after its successor and callers are proven.

## Downward Reconciliation

An upper-level change must identify affected lower projections. Reconcile them
in the same change when possible. If implementation cannot yet follow a target
decision, preserve the target, report the current implementation honestly and
record one roadmap gap. Never weaken the target to match accidental current
code, and never claim the target is implemented from prose alone.

## Machine Contract Admission

Machine-readable contracts live in `packages/contracts/**`. A fact belongs
there only when all of the following are true:

1. It has one named authority owner.
2. A current runtime, cross-module caller, public interface, security rule,
   data-integrity rule or irreversible side effect depends on it.
3. Deterministic validation is more valuable than leaving the decision to the
   owning implementation.
4. The contract does not duplicate a schema, source constant, workflow or
   another contract that already owns the fact.

Colors, spacing, layout dimensions, page or slide counts, component libraries,
model choices, query strategies, batch sizes, concurrency tuning, worker
intervals, file paths, command sequences, current progress and pending evidence
do not qualify merely because tests can assert them. Use an evolvable guide,
source, API schema, performance test, workflow, `docs/status.md` or
`docs/roadmap.md` instead.

## Tests

Long-term tests should validate public behavior, authority, accessibility,
security, integrity and side-effect bounds. Source or workflow shape belongs in a
test only when that shape is itself a consumed contract.

Migration and cleanup tests are temporary. Move active callers and persisted
state to the current surface, then retire the old wrapper, route, fixture and
test together.
