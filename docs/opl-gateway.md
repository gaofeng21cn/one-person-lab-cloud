# OPL Gateway

Owner: `one-person-lab-cloud`
Purpose: `gateway_target_reference`
State: `active_target_reference`
Machine boundary: Human-readable target product reference; implementation and
readiness come from Control Plane, Sub2API, tests, status, and owner readback.

OPL Gateway is the target frontier-AI capability gateway for One Person Lab.

Sub2API is its external backend and the only owner of spendable balance, API
keys, model routing, and request usage. Cloud integrates those authorities
through Control Plane; it does not create a second Gateway service or wallet.
Its target responsibilities are unified AI API access, credential and provider
configuration, usage metering, and downstream OPL workflow integration.

## Role In OPL Cloud

OPL Gateway is the first capability foundation in the target Cloud delivery
order and remains a top-level product surface. Its planned consumers include:

- OPL App AI capability access.
- Codex and automation workflow integration.
- OPL Serve invocation and session model access.
- Usage visibility and quota management.
- A stable foundation for Console billing and account policy.

## Usage Model

Gateway usage should be groupable by:

- account;
- user, publisher service or consumer identity;
- Workspace;
- Agent Service, Revision, Deployment and Invocation/Session;
- task or job;
- exact OPL Package ref or Agent Instance;
- provider and model.

This gives Console enough information for quotas, budgets, service/package
attribution and downstream reporting without making Gateway responsible for
package lifecycle, service deployment or industry-specific policy.

Gateway is a top-level product surface that users configure, use, meter, and
pay for directly.

## Public Surface

This repository contains the Control Plane integration for Sub2API balance,
usage, balance history, Key lifecycle, and deterministic debit/refund paths.
That code and its tests are not runtime availability evidence. Current
capability belongs to [status](status.md); the remaining Core gap belongs to the
[roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Positioning

OPL Gateway should be described as OPL Cloud's AI capability foundation, not as
a generic token platform.

## Boundary With Fabric

OPL Fabric owns general connectors, compute, storage, environments, and
execution adapters. OPL Gateway owns frontier AI access, provider policy, model
routing, keys, and usage metering. OPL Serve owns the external Agent endpoint;
it does not turn Gateway into the Agent Service control plane.


## Target Agent interaction boundary under product review

Serve may invoke Gateway for model access, usage, and provider policy, but
Gateway remains the authority for model routing, Keys, usage, and spendable
balance through its external integration. Gateway does not own Package
identity, OCI builds, Workspace deployment, Agent readiness, or the Serve
access route. Those facts are passed by opaque references and owner readbacks.
